    <h2>Winona UI Components </h2>
    <h3> are absolutely NOT inspired by Windows designs!</h3>
    <p>Our naming and approach are rooted in the philosophy of cross-platform compatibility and reliability,
      particularly for developers who work on Windows systems.</p>
    <p>The name "Winona" signifies our commitment to ensuring that if our
      components run smoothly on Windows, they can run on any platform effortlessly.</p>
    <p>
      While the name might hint at a connection to Windows, our components are designed with universal usability in
      mind,
      focusing on performance, consistency, and ease of integration across all major frameworks like Angular, React, and
      Vue. </p>
    <p>Winona UI is about empowering developers with reliable tools, irrespective of their operating system choice (or
      circumstances).
